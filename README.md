So you want to add/modify the source code:
-----------------------------------------------------------------------
Rule #0:  This current version uses a SB/SB16 library, written by one
          of the authors - consult him if you wish to use his code...
          *** This version was compiled with *TWO* SB libs, one for the
          older soundblasters, for compatibility

Rule #1:  Go for it!!!  This is a free project - make it big!

Rule #2:  Send me (zaph@torps.com) a copy, so I can master the
          code for other people.

Rule #3:  Send me some Email telling me which bits you are playing with,
          and I will keep you up to date if I (or anyone else) make any
          major changes to the code.

Rule #4:  Put your name/email address in the code, that way you get to
          share the fame :-)

Rule #5:  There is no Rule #5

Rule #6:  PLEASE keep me up to date, with any little functions or ideas
          you have... The program is evolving quickly, and I'd love to
          incorporate your ideas!

Rule #7:  Translation tables:
          If you design a weird and wonderful translation table, send
          me either the table (zipped) or the code used to generate it!
